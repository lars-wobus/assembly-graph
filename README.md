# Assembly Graph

The editor script creates GraphViz files that are either saved in your Assets folder or opened via https://quickchart.io/ in your default browser.

## Background Info

- The tool was developed as part of a scientific paper describing a method for minimizing dependencies between Unity assemblies. Among other things, the use of the Object Adapter pattern is examined there. Some sample scripts can be found in an optional folder.

- It was planned to upload the Unity project to the Unity Asset Store. Due to the slow approval process, it has not yet been published there.

- The scientific paper has not yet been published, so please be patient. It was written in German and has not yet been translated into English.
